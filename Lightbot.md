* Lightbot

Lightbot was a fun experience. Although I struggled most of the time, it gave me an in depth example of how coding really works. I think it was interesting how they also added the function feature because it made it a lot easier an I'm assuming that's waht coders use in their day to day jobs. It was really interesting also how much the versions got better and easier each time. The were features in the second version that let you click instead of dragging the command which made it more efficiant for the player. Lightbot helped me a lot with learning the framework and basics of programming and it was a small introduction into that world. On their website, it says that this game is meant to teach with sequencing, overloading, recursive loops, and conditionals which all true because of how the game progressively adds more and more features with each version.

Robomind was similar to Lightbot in the lessons learned from it. By giving the robot commands, my knowledge of the abilities that robots have has expanded. It showed me the logical thinking of real world problems that robots help with, including moving heavy objects and making things faster and more efficiant. We are shown the advancements of technology nowadays and the advancements that robots are useful for. Since my dream is to become a doctor, I have to be familiar with the capabilities of technology and how it can benefit me.
