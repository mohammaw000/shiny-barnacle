* Lightbot

Lightbot was a fun experience. Although I struggled most of the time, it gave me an in depth example of how coding really works. I think it was interesting how they also added the function feature because it made it a lot easier an I'm assuming that's waht coders use in their day to day jobs. It was really interesting also how much the versions got better and easier each time. The were features in the second version that let you click instead of dragging the command which made it more efficiant for the player.
