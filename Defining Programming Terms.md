<b>Defining Programming Terms</b>

Programming is the set of instructions that are given to a computer to be executed. They are somewhat like commands that you give the computer and it should follow them. The instructions that are given are always written in a programming language that the computer can understand such as Java, C++, and Python.

- <b>Loop</b>: A loop is a certain piece of instructions that is repeated over and over until a certain goal or condition is reached.
- <b>Function</b>: A function is a group of statements or commands that is grouped together in order to perform a certain task. It makes programming faster and more efficiant so that you won't have to keep writing in the same statements each time if you need to repeat.
- <b>Conditional</b>: A conditional is somewhat like an "if-then" statement. For example, when ATMs are programmed, they make it so that IF someone withdrawls THEN the ATM says "thank you and take your money!" It is basically saying the statement is defind true unless a true hypothesis tells it otherwise.
